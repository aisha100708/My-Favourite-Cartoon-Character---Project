                        Dora the Explorer is a 7 year old, Latino girl. Dora uses her knowledge of the Spanish language to communicate with her friends, overcome obstacles and reach her goals. In each episode, Dora teaches the viewers a Spanish word or phrase and then asks them to use it to help solve a problem. The show is often accompanied by a variety of Dora's friends -- Isa the Iguana, Boots the monkey, Benny the Bull, the Fiesta Trio (a bug band), SeÃ±or Tucan, Tico (I was not sure what Tico was but Monica and her son wrote to let me know that it is a squirrel...Thanks!), Swiper the Fox and Dora's Map and Backpack (which have have faces and personalities). Dora's world resembles an animated computer game. A cursor arrow points at possible answers to questions and the right answer is announced with a clicking sound. Dora helps children in the toddler and preschool age group learn colors, counting, and words in Spanish and English. Young viewers are urged to participate in a variety of ways including shouting out words and reminding the characters of certain tasks. Latin culture is represented through the main character, the Spanish language and Latin music.
